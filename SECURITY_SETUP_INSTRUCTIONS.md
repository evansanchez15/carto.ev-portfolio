# Security Setup Instructions üîí

## Overview
Your contact form now includes three layers of security protection:

1. ‚úÖ **Google reCAPTCHA v3** - Invisible bot protection
2. ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting** - Max 5 submissions per hour per IP address
3. ‚úÖ **Input Sanitization** - Prevents XSS and injection attacks

---

## Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Google reCAPTCHA Keys

1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Click **"+"** to create a new site
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Label**: Portfolio Contact Form (or any name you prefer)
   - **reCAPTCHA type**: Select **"reCAPTCHA v3"**
   - **Domains**: Add your domains:
     - `localhost` (for local testing)
     - `your-site-name.vercel.app` (your production domain)
     - Add any custom domains you have
   - **Accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service**
4. Click **Submit**
5. You'll see two keys:
   - **Site Key** (starts with 6L...)
   - **Secret Key** (starts with 6L...)
   
   **Keep these keys safe!**

### Step 2: Update Local Environment Variables

Open or create `.env.local` in your project root and add:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=evanmsanchez15@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password-here

# reCAPTCHA Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-site-key-here
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

**Important Notes:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - Must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` (this is used in the browser)
- `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` - Server-side only (never exposed to browser)
- Replace `your-site-key-here` with your actual Site Key from Step 1
- Replace `your-secret-key-here` with your actual Secret Key from Step 1

### Step 3: Update Vercel Environment Variables

For production deployment, add these environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add the following variables:

| Key | Value | Environments |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `EMAIL_USER` | `evanmsanchez15@gmail.com` | ‚úì All |
| `EMAIL_PASSWORD` | Your Gmail App Password | ‚úì All |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` | Your reCAPTCHA Site Key | ‚úì All |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | Your reCAPTCHA Secret Key | ‚úì All |

5. Click **Save** for each variable
6. **Redeploy** your site for changes to take effect

## Security Features Explained

### 1. Google reCAPTCHA v3 (Invisible)
- **What it does**: Analyzes user behavior to determine if they're human or bot
- **Score-based**: Assigns a score from 0.0 (bot) to 1.0 (human)
- **Threshold**: Set to 0.5 (blocks suspicious traffic)
- **User Experience**: Completely invisible - no clicking required
- **Fallback**: If reCAPTCHA is not configured, form still works (for testing)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- **What it does**: Limits form submissions per IP address
- **Limit**: Maximum 5 submissions per hour per IP
- **Response**: Returns 429 error with message "Too many requests"
- **Storage**: In-memory (resets on server restart)
- **Production Note**: For high-traffic sites, consider Redis or database storage

### 3. Input Sanitization
- **What it does**: Cleans and validates user input
- **Name**: Max 100 characters, min 2 characters
- **Email**: Validates format using validator library
- **Message**: Max 5000 characters, min 10 characters
- **XSS Prevention**: Encodes HTML special characters (< > " ' /)
- **Email Info**: Includes IP address and rate limit info for tracking

## Testing Locally

After setting up environment variables:

1. Restart your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/contact`

3. Fill out the form and submit

4. Check your email at `evanmsanchez15@gmail.com`

5. **Test Rate Limiting**: Try submitting 6+ times within an hour to see the rate limit error

---

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check for Bot Activity
- Emails include IP address and remaining rate limit attempts
- Monitor for patterns of suspicious submissions

### Adjust reCAPTCHA Score Threshold
If you're getting too many false positives (real users blocked):
- Edit `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`
- Find: `data.score >= 0.5`
- Lower to `0.3` for more lenient filtering

If you're getting spam:
- Raise to `0.7` for stricter filtering

### View reCAPTCHA Analytics
- Go to [reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
- Click on your site
- View statistics and analytics

---

## Troubleshooting

### "reCAPTCHA verification failed"
- Check that both keys are correctly added to environment variables
- Verify your domain is added in reCAPTCHA admin console
- Make sure you're using v3 keys (not v2)

### "Too many requests"
- This is working as intended
- Wait 1 hour and try again
- Or restart your dev server (resets in-memory rate limiting)

### Emails not sending
- Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are set
- Check Gmail App Password is correct
- Review server logs for errors

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

- ‚úÖ Add all 4 environment variables to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Add production domain to reCAPTCHA admin console
- ‚úÖ Redeploy site after adding environment variables
- ‚úÖ Test form on production site
- ‚úÖ Verify email delivery
- ‚úÖ Test rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Monitor for spam in first few days

---

## Security Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Never share your Secret Key publicly
- ‚úÖ Rotate Gmail App Password periodically
- ‚úÖ Monitor reCAPTCHA analytics regularly
- ‚úÖ Keep dependencies updated: `npm audit` and `npm update`
- ‚úÖ Review email logs for suspicious patterns
